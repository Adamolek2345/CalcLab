This is the first version of PyCalc Battery Calculator (release 1.0), and MAY contain errors.
If you find any of these, please report them to my git page, so I can fix them.
Thank you in advance, Adamolek234


# Compatibility
I want to imply that this calculatro works in the standard python 3 console, without any packages (screenshot below).
